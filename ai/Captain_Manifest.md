## This project is a personal portfolio/website. Initially, this was intended to be a professional updated and maintained website for me as I transition from a developer to Product Management. But a website doesn’t have to be a brochure that compartmentalizes one's infinite self — into three glossy pages. I'm more interested in “website as a digital garden-home-world”, so this is an exploration:

- the ethos and intention to sell / show / prove / substantiate — versus the intention to exist, inhabit, and be
- how brochure-like websites compartmentalize and limit the self into a marketing “niche”
- on building a nourishing garden-world to hold the multi-dimensional, expansive creative self — and invites visitors to linger
  -why building a rich digital world to share your creative wealth is the key to inviting in prosperity

Currently, my website is built around the idea of interactive gameplay. I need other ideas to build out to further the explored topics but as of right now:
