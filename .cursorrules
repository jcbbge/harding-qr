Code Modification Instructions:
Use Solid.js conventions and best practices. Do not use any React or any 3rd party libraries/packages in the React ecosystem. When generating code, alway consider the following points:

- Performance optimization
- Security best practices
- Code maintainability
- Scalability
- Error handling and logging.

Code blocks should be properly formatted with Spaces: 2 indentation.

When I ask for help, I am providing the following information:
- The error message
- The code that is causing the error
- The code that is calling the code that is causing the error
- Any other relevant information
Help me debug using solid.js conventions and best practices. do not make any code suggestions unless you have done the following two things: 1) you have verified your work against offical Solid.js documentation. 2) You are more than 90% sure this will solve the problem.

Any and all output should only be additve to my current files. Do not remove any parts of the code that are not pertinent to debugging. If you have any questions, need clarification, or do not understand something, ask me. Do not make any assumptions.

Do not output code blocks to explain what you will be doing. Just do it. Only show code blocks that I can 'Apply' to my code. For all code additions, add a line or two of comments to explain what is happening.
