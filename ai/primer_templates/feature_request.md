## Instructions

1. **Confirm Understanding**:

   - Please summarize your understanding of the task before making any changes.

2. **Step-by-Step Implementation**:

   - **Step 1**: Define the requirements and specifications for the new feature.
   - **Step 2**: Implement the feature in `[Path to relevant file 1]`.
   - **Step 3**: Update or create necessary state management in `[Path to relevant file 2]`.
   - **Step 4**: Modify `[Path to relevant file 3]` to integrate the new feature.
   - **Step 5**: Ensure persistence and accessibility of the feature.
   - **Step 6**: Test the feature across different scenarios and devices.

3. **Provide Summary**:

   - After completing the changes, provide a detailed summary of what was done and any potential impacts.
   - Annotate the code with comments to explain the functionality and changes made using this pattern: `// comments go here...`. Make sure that all comments are on new lines above the code block and not inline with the code.
   - Never add comments to any `.css` files.

4. **Await Approval**:
