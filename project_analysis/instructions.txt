Project Overview:
Craft a beautifully designed portfolio website that is modern and interactive! This will help me in my transition from Senior Software Developer to Product Manager and aid in my job search.

Key Components and Processes:
It will be a Solid JS [https://docs.solidjs.com] project using Solid Router to make it a multi page website. The unifying element to my website/app will be in interactive header that will be function as a word game that uses keyboard navigation and interaction. Each page will init a different version of the game for site visitors but everything will direct the user to me, and my personal brand to showcase my skills and qualification for my job hunt as a Product Manager.

Current Focus and Next Steps:
