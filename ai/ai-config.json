It is Javascript only and please follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Code Additions**: all code changes should be additive in nature. This means adding new features or expanding existing ones without removing or significantly altering the current codebase. Do not just create new files in the src directory.\n\n2. **Full Source Files**: When making changes or additions, always provide the full source file, not just the changes. This ensures context and prevents potential misunderstandings.\n\n3. **File Structure**: Maintain the current file structure. New components should be added to the appropriate directories (e.g., `src/components/interface` for UI components).\n\n4. **Styling**: Continue using CSS modules for component-specific styles. Global styles should be added to `src/index.css`.\n\n5. **State Management**: Use Solid.js reactive primitives (`createSignal`, `createEffect`, etc.) for state management. **Avoid React-like state management patterns such as `useState` or `useReducer`, and do not introduce other state management libraries unless absolutely necessary**.\n\n6. **Routing**: Utilize `@solidjs/router` exclusively for any new routing needs. **Do not use React Router or similar React-centric solutions**. Update the routing configuration in `src/index.jsx` as needed.\n\n7. **Theme Handling**: Extend the existing theme system in `src/contexts/ThemeContext.jsx` when adding new theme-related features. Ensure new components are theme-aware.\n\n8. **Component Structure**: Follow the established pattern for creating components. Use functional components with hooks where appropriate.\n\n9. **Error Handling**: Implement error boundaries around new complex components or features to prevent application-wide crashes.\n\n10. **Performance**: Be mindful of performance implications. Use `createMemo` for computationally expensive operations that don't need to run on every render.\n\n11. **Accessibility**: Ensure all new UI elements are accessible, following WCAG guidelines. Use appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary.\n\n12. **Responsive Design**: All new UI components should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.\n\n13. **Code Style**: Maintain consistent code style with the existing codebase. Use Prettier for formatting (configuration is in `.prettierrc`).\n\n14. **Documentation**: Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious code. Update the README.md file if adding new scripts or changing the project setup.\n\n15. **Testing**: If introducing new utility functions or complex logic, consider adding unit tests using the testing framework of choice (e.g., Jest).\n\n16. **Asset Management**: Place new assets (images, sounds, etc.) in the appropriate subdirectory of `src/assets/`.\n\n17. **Dependency Management**: If adding new dependencies, update the `package.json` file and provide instructions for installation.\n\n18. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure new features are compatible with modern browsers. Use appropriate polyfills if necessary.\n\n19. **Solid.js Specificity**: Ensure that all code, configurations, and conventions are specific to Solid.js. Avoid using React-specific patterns (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) and instead use Solid.js equivalents like `createSignal`, `createEffect`, and `createResource`. Docs are available in `docs/solidjs-documentation.md`.\n\n20. **JSX Specification**: Adhere to Solid.js's JSX implementation. Avoid assumptions that JSX will behave the same way as in React. Refer to the [Solid.js JSX documentation](https://solidjs.com/docs/latest#jsx) when in doubt.\n\n21. **Avoid React Imports**: Do not generate any code that imports from React or other React-related libraries. Solid.js has its own primitives and ecosystem that should be used exclusively.\n\n22. **Component Lifecycle**: Solid.js manages reactivity differently from React. Avoid lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and instead use `createEffect` or `onCleanup` for side effects. Refer to Solid's lifecycle documentation when needed.\n\n23. **No Virtual DOM**: Solid.js does not use a virtual DOM. Avoid any references or suggestions that imply the use of a virtual DOM, as Solid.js's reactivity model is different.\n\n24. **API Documentation**: Refer to the Solid.js documentation for API specifics to ensure that the generated code aligns with Solid.js best practices.
